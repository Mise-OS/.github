# Mise-OS

**Everything in its place, before it hits production.**

Mise-OS is a Git-native operating system for repo stewardship, pull request hygiene, automation, CI/CD, contributor workflows, and ethical AI-assisted development.

We turn software chaos into coordinated service.

## Core Stations

| Station | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Mise Orchestra | Control plane for coordinated repo operations |
| Mise Branch Steward | Branch recommendations, merge readiness, cleanup |
| Mise PR | Pull request hygiene and review packets |
| Repo Pet | Mascot-led repo roaming, onboarding, and branded interaction |
| Mise Brigade de Repo | Repository stewardship and quality gates |
| Mise Governance | Safety, review, approval, and human-in-the-loop rules |

## Operating Principle

Every agent has a role.  
Every role has purpose.  
Every repo has a station.  
Every station serves the whole kitchen.

## Signature

Good People. Good Things in Motion.

> **Intro video slot:** GitHub README pages are most reliable with a poster/GIF at the top. The staged hero poster is `assets/brand/miseos-intro-poster.jpeg`. Add a final video export at `assets/intro/miseos-intro.mp4` when available and keep the poster as the fallback.

## The kitchen is open

Mise OS turns autonomous development into a coordinated kitchen service:

- Every agent becomes a chef.
- Every repository becomes a kitchen.
- Every deployment becomes a service.
- Every workflow becomes an orchestra.

## Software matrix

| Layer | Current project standard |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js `>=24.18.0` |
| Module system | Native ESM |
| Package manager | npm |
| External dependencies | None |
| CLI entrypoint | `mise-roam` |
| Safe-read mode | Metadata-only by default |
| Optional read mode | `--peek` for small non-secret-looking files |
| Last updated | 2026-06-25 |

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run doctor
npm run roam
```

Run the repo mascot through the current repository:

```bash
node scripts/mise-roamer.mjs . --max-depth=6 --tick=650
```

Let a specific chef roam:

```bash
node scripts/mise-roamer.mjs . --chef=kurogami-senpai
node scripts/mise-roamer.mjs . --chef=seira --peek
node scripts/mise-roamer.mjs . --chef=streama --max-depth=7
```

Brand every folder with a `MISE.md` station card:

```bash
npm run brand:folders
npm run brand:check
```

## Repo roamer

The Mise roamer is a Shimeji-style terminal mascot adapted for repositories. Instead of walking across a desktop, each chef wanders through folders, reads safe metadata, reacts to files, and keeps a recent service trail.

Safety rules:

- Does not write, delete, rename, or mutate files.
- Does not follow symlinks.
- Ignores `.git`, `node_modules`, build outputs, caches, virtual environments, and OS system folders.
- Masks secret-like filenames.
- Reads file contents only with `--peek`, and only for small, non-secret-looking source/docs/config files.

Intent → Orchestrate → Execute → Observe → Improve
```

Every folder is a station.  
Every file is an ingredient.  
Every agent has a role.  
Every role has purpose.
